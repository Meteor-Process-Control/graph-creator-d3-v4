# graph-creator-d3-v4
transform the directed-graph-creator to pass d3 v4

The project https://github.com/cjrd/directed-graph-creator has create a Interactive tool for creating directed graphs, created using d3.js. But when d3.js update from v3 to v4, this project can not run any more. 
This is a very cool project, so i will rewrite the project with d3.v4.js and add something new.
